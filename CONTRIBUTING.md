## **Contribution License Agreement**

The contributor (**“You”**) agrees to this Contribution License Agreement (**“Agreement”**) which conveys certain license rights to Neustar, Inc. (**“Neustar”**) for Your contributions to Neustar open source projects.

1. **Definitions.**

    **“Code”** means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form, that is Submitted by You to Neustar under this Agreement.

    **“Project”** means any of the projects owned or managed by Neustar and offered under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (www.opensource.org).

    **“Submit”** is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any Project or to Neustar directly relating to any Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of  discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Submission.”

    **“Submission”** means the Code and any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any associated comments and documentation.

2. **Your Submission.** You must agree to the terms of this Agreement before making a Submission to any Project. This Agreement covers any and all Submissions that You, now or in the future (except as described in Section 4 below), Submit to Neustar related to any Project.  You acknowledge and agree that: (a) Neustar has no obligation to include a Submission as part of a Project and no Submission shall be treated as confidential, and (b) Neustar may modify Your Submission and/or combine it with other Submissions relating to a Project. 

3. **Originality of Work**.

      a. **Your Work**. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work, and You own all rights to such Submission (see section 3b for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Submission submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Submissions.
      
      b. **Third-Party Work**. Should You wish to Submit work that is not Your original creation, You may Submit it to separately from any other Submission, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

      c. **Your Employer.** References to “employer” in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else for whom You are acting in making Your Submission (e.g., as a contractor, vendor, or agent). If Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law, You must first secure permission from Your  employer to make the Submission. In that case, the term “You” in this Agreement will refer to You and the employer collectively. If You change employers in the future and desire to Submit additional Submissions for the new employer, then You agree to first secure permission from the new employer before Submitting those Submissions.

4. **Licenses.**

      a. **Copyright License.** You grant Neustar, and those who receive the Submission directly or indirectly from Neustar, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the Submission to reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,  and distribute the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties, including as part of a Project and separately from a Project.

      b. **Patent License.** You grant Neustar, and those who receive the Submission directly or indirectly from Neustar, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under Your patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the Submission or the combination of the Submission with the Project to which it was Submitted to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import or otherwise dispose of the Submission alone or with the Project.

      c. **Other Rights Reserved.** Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation, any implied licenses) are granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.

5. **Representations and Warranties.** You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work (except as You may have disclosed under Section 3). You represent that You have secured permission from Your employer to make the Submission in cases where Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for Your employer, or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law. If a contributor on behalf of Your employer, You represent and warrant that You have the necessary authority to bind the listed employer to the obligations contained in this Agreement. You are not expected to provide support for Your Submission unless You choose to do so. UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 3, 4, AND 6, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

6. **Notice to Neustar.** You agree to notify Neustar in writing of any facts or circumstances of which You later become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

7. **Information about Submissions.** You agree that contributions to Projects and information about contributions may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including Your name and other information that You submit with Your Submission.

8. **Governing Law/Jurisdiction.** This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in Alexandria, Virginia, unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in Fairfax County, Virginia. The parties waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.

9. **Entire Agreement/Assignment.** This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be assigned by Neustar.
